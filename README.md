### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Artino Lotus. I like Node.JS, TypeScript and Kotlin/JS. JVM is fine too, I guess.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on probably porting stuff either to Kotlin or TypeScript.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Deno.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Hacktoberfest.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m not looking for help. You're the one looking for help.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about... actually, don't. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Don't. Or through GitHub itself.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him or They/them.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Everyone always dies in the end.
